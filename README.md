# Test-your-knowledge-quiz

Description

The motivation for this project is to create a coding quiz for users who want to test their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I built this project to allow users to see thier knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project shows off my skills working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I learned a lot about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also other components like id's, classes, loops and if/else statements.
